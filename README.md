# bioDivMaps

The bioDivMaps module can be used for creating web-based biodiversity oriented maps. The module is written in Javascript. It takes advantage of the 
powerful d3.js (https://d3js.org/) visualization library and the HTML canvas element (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) for efficient handling of big raster data sets.
